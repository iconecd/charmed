Step one: find a better name.

This utility converts characters to and from escaped HTML entities, ascii values, and unicode characters. Just call .toHtml( string ) and your ascii characters and unicode characters will escape out. .toAscii( string ) turns them to ASCII. .toUnicode( string ) does what it says on the tin.
